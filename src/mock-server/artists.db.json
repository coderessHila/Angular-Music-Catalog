      "about": "Madonna, original name Madonna Louise Ciccone, (born August 16, 1958, Bay City, Michigan, U.S.), American singer, songwriter, actress, and entrepreneur whose immense popularity in the 1980s and ’90s allowed her to achieve levels of power and control that were nearly unprecedented for a woman in the entertainment industry.Born into a large Italian American family, Madonna studied dance at the University of Michigan and with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in New York City in the late 1970s before relocating briefly to Paris as a member of Patrick Hernandez’s disco revue. Returning to New York City, she performed with a number of rock groups before signing with Sire Records. Her first hit, “Holiday,” in 1983, provided the blueprint for her later material—an upbeat dance club sound with sharp production and an immediate appeal. Madonna’s melodic pop incorporated catchy choruses, and her lyrics concerned love, sex, and relationships—ranging from the breezy innocence of “True Blue” (1986) to the erotic fantasies of “Justify My Love” (1990) to the spirituality of later songs such as “Ray of Light” (1998).

      "about": "Although their blend of emo-pop and slick, anthemic rock & roll eventually made them stars on both sides of the Atlantic, Paramore began humbly enough in Franklin, Tennessee, where Hayley Williams met brothers Josh and Zac Farro after moving to town from Mississippi. Already a powerhouse vocalist at the age of 13, Williams joined a band that the Farro siblings had formed with local guitarist Taylor York. She left the group soon after, signing with Atlantic Records as a solo artist instead, but clashed with the label over the direction of her music. Seeking to front her own band, Williams convinced Atlantic to let her piece together a full lineup. Josh and Zac Farro were recruited for the job, as were guitarist Jason Bynum and bassist Jeremy Davis.All We Know Is FallingFrom the start, Paramore's poppy melodies and zippy songwriting seemed to contradict the fact that none of the bandmates (with the exception of Davis) were older than 18. To help attract a younger audience, Atlantic decided to share the band with Fueled by Ramen, a Florida-based label with a strong roster of emo-pop acts.",

      "about": "Ozzy Osbourne, byname of John Michael Osbourne, (born December 3, 1948, Birmingham, England), British musician who gained a loyal following as the vocalist for the heavy metal group Black Sabbath before embarking on a successful solo career.\n\nRaised in a working-class family, Osbourne dropped out of school at age 15 and held several low-paying jobs. He also engaged in petty crime and at 17 was imprisoned for two months for burglary. After his release, he sang in a number of local rock groups, eventually forming the rock band Earth with guitarist Tony Iommi. To avoid confusion with another band of the same name, the group changed its name to Black Sabbath—after an old Boris Karloff movie. The group developed a grinding, ominous sound, based on the blues but intensely amplified, and drew attention with its tendency to reference the occult in its lyrics. In February 1970 Black Sabbath released its eponymous first album and quickly developed a following in both Britain and the United States."

      "about": "Fleetwood Mac, British blues band that evolved into the hugely popular Anglo-American pop-rock group whose 1977 album Rumours was one of the biggest-selling albums of all time. The original members were Mick Fleetwood (b. June 24, 1947, Redruth, Cornwall, England), John McVie (b. November 26, 1945, London, England), Peter Green (original name Peter Greenbaum; b. October 29, 1946, London—d. July 25, 2020, Canvey Island, Sussex), and Jeremy Spencer (b. July 4, 1948, West Hartlepool, Durham, England). Later members included Danny Kirwan (b. May 13, 1950, London—d. June 8, 2018, London), Christine McVie (original name Christine Perfect; b. July 12, 1943, Birmingham, West Midlands, England), Bob Welch (b. August 31, 1945, Los Angeles, California, U.S.—d. June 7, 2012, Nashville, Tennessee), Stevie Nicks (b. May 26, 1948, Phoenix, Arizona, U.S.), and Lindsey Buckingham (b. October 3, 1947, Palo Alto, California).\n\nBegun in 1967 by former members of John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers—guitarist Green, drummer Fleetwood, bassist John McVie—and slide guitarist Spencer, Fleetwood Mac found instant success during the British blues boom with its debut album and the hit single “Albatross” (1968). Thereafter the band experienced more moderate success while undergoing multiple personnel changes (including Green’s departure and the addition of McVie’s wife, keyboardist-vocalist-songwriter Christine). A move to the United States in 1974 and the addition of singer-songwriters Nicks and Buckingham (the latter an accomplished guitarist) infused the group with a pop sensibility that resulted in the multimillion-selling Fleetwood Mac (1975) and Rumours. Evocatively reflecting the simultaneous breakups of the McVies’ marriage and Buckingham and Nicks’s relationship, Rumours—which won the Grammy Award for album of the year—epitomized the band’s accomplished songwriting, arresting vocal chemistry, and rock-solid rhythm section."

December 15, 1939, Camden, New Jersey).\n\nNot only were the Supremes the Motown label’s primary crossover act, they also helped change the public image of African Americans during the civil rights era. With their sequined evening gowns and the sophisticated pop-soul swing given them by the songwriting-production team of Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Eddie Holland from 1964 to 1967, the Supremes were the idealized look and sound of the “integrated Negro.” Indeed, the youth of America learned many of its first lessons about racial equality from teen magazines that documented every hyperglamourized move the Supremes made as they went from topping the pop chart to appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show to sold-out Las Vegas, Nevada, bookings."

Blaylock grew up singing in choirs, and by her teens she was already in a working band with her family and local songwriter Steve Smith. Smith brought guitarist Berner -- he had actually taught Berner his first chords on the instrument -- into the group. Berner and Green had played together a few times while both were in college, and when a mandolin opening came up in the band, Berner brought Green aboard. Now a trio, and with the name Edens Edge, they began to attract attention with their bright vocal sound. When veteran songwriter Kye Fleming (“I Was Country When Country Wasn’t Cool,” “Smoky Mountain Rain”) discovered they were based a mere 40 miles down the road from where she grew up in Fort Smith, Arkansas, she urged them to move to Nashville and work with her on honing their sound. Edens Edge officially made the move to Nashville in 2007, mentored with Fleming, and after performing a medley of Fleming's songs when she was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame (with , , and other industry heavyweights in attendance), the group was offered a deal by . Working with producer Mark Bright, they began recording a debut album for the label. A lead single, “Amen,” which paints a portrait of love in a small town, was issued in 2011. ~ Steve Leggett, Rovi"

The united mainstream FM rockers, self-conscious new wavers, and the pierced, tattooed toughs that still uneasily roamed the earth like vestigial body parts as the Me Generation tottered to an unsteady start.\n\nWhat is probably most significant is that it took a single woman, born and raised in one of the grittier bowels of the American Midwest, who answered an urgent call to travel to the U .K . for her own rock & roll baptism."

The Corrs' first studio album, Forgiven, Not Forgotten (released via Lava/Atlantic Records in America), became internationally popular, but nowhere more so than in their homeland, where the LP's four-times-platinum status made it one of the most popular debuts by an Irish group."

Between 1984 and 1990, Collins had a string of 13 straight U.S. Top Ten hits.  Long before any of that happened, however, Collins was a child actor/singer who appeared as the Artful Dodger in the London production of Oliver! in 1964. (He also has a cameo in A Hard Day's Night, among other films.) He got his first break in music in his late teens, when he was chosen to be a replacement drummer in the British art rock band Genesis in 1970.",

Eurythmics’ lyrics and imagery presaged the third wave of feminism and a more mainstream deconstruction of sexuality and gender, with their videos and live performances featuring androgynous frontwoman Annie Lennox, at once formidable and alluring. The stories the band told, through song and theatrics, spoke to what it meant to live and love in the late 20th century.",

      "about": " Virtuosic Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen is credited for originating the fleet-fingered neo-classical style that took the heavy metal world by storm in the early 1980s. Combining a dazzling technique honed over years of obsessive practice, and with a love for rock gods such as Jimi Hendrix and Ritchie Blackmore and composers like Bach, Beethoven, and Paganini, Malmsteen's distinctively Baroque, gothic compositional style and lightning-fast arpeggiated solos rewrote the book on heavy metal guitar. His debut album, 1984's Rising Force, upped the ante for aspiring hard rock guitarists and proved the major catalyst for the '80s guitar phenomenon known as \"shredding.\" With an ego to match his considerable talents, Malmsteen blazed a fiery path through the '80s and early '90s, though like many artists in the metal realm, he was forced to lie low during the grunge and alternative rock boom.",
